# The explanation there should be like:

# The words in the file at vocab_path in the config.toml file are should have spaces or new lines between them.
# If vocab_known in config.toml is true, these words are considered as Known vocabulary.
# If vocab_known in config.toml is false, these words are considered as Unknown vocabulary.
