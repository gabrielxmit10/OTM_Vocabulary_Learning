You have n_of_books and want to read n_of_books_to_read.
Here are the results for your choice.

You can learn up to X words out of Y unknown words found in these n_of_books.
(We aren't sure if this is the maximum possible, but it's what our solver found, given your time limit)
# Only shows if User configured a time limit for the solver in the config.toml file



Order to read the books in:
    "Name_of_Book_1", "Name_of_Book_2", "Name_of_Book_3", ...
    # or maybe one in each line, idk yet



Words learned per book in order learned:
    "Name_of_Book_1" (W1):
        word1_1 word1_2 word1_3 ...
    "Name_of_Book_2" (W2):
        word2_1 word2_2 word2_3 ...
    "Name_of_Book_3" (W3):
        word3_1 word3_2 word3_3 ...
# These quotes around the book names ("Name_of_Book_n") are to be done at the final version
# Wn is the number of words learned in that book, so Sum(W1, W2, W3, ...) = X, of course.



Books not read: 
    Name_of_Book_A, Name_of_Book_B, Name_of_Book_C, ...
# Only happens if n_of_books_to_read < n_of_books

Words failed to learn in alphabetical order:
    word1 word2 word3 ...



# See about this later, idk if we'll have this or not yet:
Total time taken: HH:MM:SS.ssssss
Total time taken for Simplification of Expressions: HH:MM:SS.ssssss
Total time taken for Solving Optimization Problem: HH:MM:SS.ssssss
# If time limit was set, write this last one like :
    # Total time taken for Solving Optimization Problem: HH:MM:SS.ssssss (Stopped due to time limit)



The program didn't consider some words given by your vocabulary file.
This is because they might be names, made up words, or words that don't fit the language model.
These words are:
    wordX wordY wordZ ...
# If all words were considered, this section won't appear
# Not considered words are ignored in the program, so its like they are known words. Write this in the README or sth.
